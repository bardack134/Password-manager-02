# Password-manager-02
This project is similar to the “Password Manager project”, but the difference is that it uses the JSON format to save data (in data.json), instead of a .TXT file (data.txt).

*I use ‘try’ and ‘except’ to handle errors, for example when we add a new password but haven’t filled all the fields yet, or when we already have a specific password saved and we try to overwrite it.

*The password is saved encrypted and decrypted using a module I created using the Caesar Cipher method.

*There is a master password that we need to use if we want to see the saved passwords."
